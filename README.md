# Create.net Boilerplate

## A modular CSS framework for styling the [Create.net](https://www.create.net/) WDK eCommerce platform

Weâ€™ve decided to open source the building blocks we use to create the CSS front-end of our customer templates. This framework is aimed at our [WDK](http://www.create.net/web_designers_kit.phtml) users but we welcome anyone to use it on their own projects, [fork](https://github.com/createdotnet/boilerplate) or [raise issues](https://github.com/createdotnet/boilerplate/issues) against it.

The Boilerplate is written in Sass (Scss flavor), and uses the [BEM](http://bem.info/) naming convention.
