// Z-Index

// Using Sass lists for z-index means that new items can added in the list and it will re assign the z-index of everything in that list - without manually having to change each property.
// They can be called in the class using a sass index. It outputs the position in the list as a number.
// eg. 	.navigation {
//    		z-index: index($z-index-list, nav-main);
// 		}

// Feel free to overide this list in your theme. Existing items may need to be duplicated as items cannot be added to the default list.
