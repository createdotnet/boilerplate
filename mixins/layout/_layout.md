# Layout

The Sass partials in this directory provide a basic wireframe layout for the header, page-wrapper and footer.
There are currently 5 basic layout options availale, they should cover most use cases.

Only one of these should be imported in any project.

1. **Side Menu** - like avenue
2. **full bleed** - top menu, stripes of content that stretch 100% width. Works nice with the full bleed pagebuilder option
3. **inner contained** - top menu, all content and background colours are contained within the templates max width.
4. **footer-bleed** - a bit like "inner contained" but with a full width (but constrained) footer - top menu, like picnic
5. **header-bleed** - a bit like "inner contained" but with a full width header - top menu, like metro

> Maybe one day there will be some checking to ensure one (and only one) has been imported.
